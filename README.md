# Javasqript Pizzeria

Assignment to create a simple javasqript pizzeria where costumers can choose and order different dishes.

## The problem

Tried to do it as simple as possible using alerts, promts and conditional statements. I also made a version using switch.
If I had more time I would try to make the code less repetative and easier to read.
I had a problem with the age promt where the user can leave the input field empty, press ok and still get a confirmation. If I had more time I would try to solve that.
