# Javasqript Pizzeria

Assignment to create a simple javasqript pizzeria where costumers can choose and order different dishes.

## The problem

Tried to do it as simple as possible using alerts, promts and conditional statements.
If I had more time I would try to make the code less repetative and easier to read.
